# odin-recipes
I have been trying for last 3-4 years to start coding but every time i start 
learning something happens and i couldn't do it properly this time i have 
committed my self to have a little persistency and learn coding in this project 
i have started HTML and we i got introduced  to GIt hub , Git and to VS Code 
to Atoms , its a really interesting journey ahead of me , i have learn how 
the structure of html works which command are really important. 
I have learned that every HTML code should start with ( <!DOCTYPE HTML> and 
after that we start by putting <html> opening code and closing one </html>
after that we use two important codes head and body the head includes title and body include paragraphs, heading and images, links and other important stuff
i haven't started CSS yet i have no knowledge of CSS this is so far i have 
came and yes also with this odin project i have new experiences with linux
i am using now linux i haven't used it yet and its also really interesting 
experiences that using a operating system for first time i am really looking 
forward for learning more.
