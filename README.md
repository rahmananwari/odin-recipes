commited my self to have a little presstency and learn coding in this project 
i have started HTML and we i got interdioused to GIt hub , Git and to VS Code 
to Atoms , its a really intresting journey ahead of me , i have learn how 
the structure of html works which command are realy importent. 
I have learned that every HTML code should start with ( <!DOCTYPE HTML> and 
after that we start by putting <html> opening code and closing one </html>
after that we use two important codes head and body the head includes title and body include paragraphes, heading and images, links and other important stuff
